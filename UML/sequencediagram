doesn't survive failures, never duplicated ==
"Publisher" -> "Broker" : publish(topic, msg, QoS=0)
"Broker" -> "Subscriber" : publish(topic, msg)
"Publisher" -> "Publisher" : delete msg

== QoS1: at least once\n \
survives connection loss, can be duplicated ==
"Publisher" -> "Publisher" : store msg
"Publisher" -> "Broker" : publish(topic, msg, QoS=1)
"Broker" --> "Broker" : store msg
"Broker" -> "Subscriber" : publish(topic, msg)
"Broker" --> "Broker" : delete msg
"Broker" --> "Publisher" : PUBACK
"Publisher" --> "Publisher" : delete msg

== QoS2: only once, slowest\n \
survives connection loss, never duplicated ==
"Publisher" -> "Publisher" : store msg
"Publisher" -> "Broker" : publish(topic, msg, QoS=2)
"Broker" --> "Broker" : store msg
"Broker" -> "Subscriber" : publish(topic, msg)
"Broker"--> "Publisher" : PUBREC
"Publisher" --> "Broker" : PUBREL
"Broker" --> "Broker" : delete msg
"Broker" --> "Publisher" : PUBCOMP
"Publisher" --> "Publisher" : delete msg

== Overall QoS ==
note over Publisher, Subscriber
